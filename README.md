# dotfiles

Contains configuration for bash/zsh, git, tmux, and ack.

## Setup

Do you trust my ruby skills? If so, run `ruby setup.rb`. This will put configuration files into place, and back up any existing ones. Though you should probably back up any existing dotfiles you have that you don't want overwritten. Just to be safe.

All files prepended with an underscore will be renamed to begin with a dot instead.
